# Project Description: 

This project aims to create a database containing player stats, information about their coaches,their teams and the stadiums. The database will include: 

- Players information such as age, position, team name
- Players stats like games played, games won, defensive score, points
- Stadium information
- Coach details
- Team description

We aspire to help the viewers and managing team to get a better view of players' record and their playing status.

## Scope: 
We have selected the 2020 stats which includes all the information about the matches played during this season.

## Plan of Action:
We have used 2 websites to scrape the data: 
-https://www.basketball-reference.com/
-https://en.hispanosnba.com/nba-arenas

### Website Scraping: 
As most of the details about the NBA games and players are available on the Basketball Referenceâ€™s website, we have scraped multiple pages to gather information in thei respective tables. We have used the other website to collect the stadium details of each team. We have used Python to scrape data.
We have collated all the above data sources to create a database and established connections between them to provide precise information for the same.
